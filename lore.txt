	Space. The other galaxies. For years these were subjects that humanity approchead with curiosity and interest. We thought we would gain from knowing what was
around us. From establishing contact with other intelligent species like us. Oh, how we so were wrong.
	The year is 2018. One year has passed since scientists uselessly tried to get in contact with the outter world. Or so they fought so. One week after the signal
was sent, while nobody was expecting it, a response came. No one could believe it. Finally, after so many years of trying, after so many years spent accomplishing
nothing, progress was gonna be made. At first, it all seemed to be going just like we wanted it. The new beings were very different from us physically, sure, but we
shared an high intellect and the values of intergalatic peace and prosperity. Humanity was going in to its platinum age. But we were too naive. Of course we didn't
just open our frontiers without any backup defense if things went wrong. But oh boy, when the gate between planets was inaugurated and the aliens betrayed us and
started slaughtering our people, those defenses worked as good as a paper stopping a leak.
	95% of humanity is already dead, and 4% is held captive by the invaders, spending their days getting tortured for the fun of their hosts. Humanity's
last hope resides in the survivores who strove through many encounters and were able to develop a good-enough offensive and defensive structure. But everyday that
passes, things get rougher. The moral is down. The supplies are low. Diseases are as common as kids in a kindergarten. Can we endure this suffering and survive? Is it
even worth it at this point? There is no point of living just to survive. Can we kick back and reclaim our land and lives?
